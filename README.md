# PID_saturation
The goal is to find an efficient solution to the problem of saturation of the command action and to guarantee that the solution is better than those proposed in the literature. Saturation is an almost inevitable problem when is implemented a regulator project in practice. It can lead to system instability and deterioration of performance.
